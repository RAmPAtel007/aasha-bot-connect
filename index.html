    <meta name="description" content="The AI-Driven Public Health Chatbot for Disease Awareness is designed to provide accessible, timely, and personalized healthcare guidance, especially for rural and underserved communities. It shares preventive tips during seasonal outbreaks like dengue, malaria, flu, and heatstroke, and identifies possible causes based on user-reported symptoms, guiding users on home care or medical consultation. The system maintains vaccination schedules, sends reminders for upcoming or missed doses, and integrates government immunization records. Real-time outbreak alerts are delivered based on location-specific data from official health databases. Users can interact via WhatsApp, SMS, or a regional-language voice assistant, making the system accessible to those with limited literacy or digital skills. During emergencies, the chatbot notifies family or companions with patient location and condition, and recommends nearby hospitals. Personalized health notifications, multilingual support, and multimedia interactions enhance engagement, ensuring reliable, inclusive, and proactive healthcare management for all users.">
